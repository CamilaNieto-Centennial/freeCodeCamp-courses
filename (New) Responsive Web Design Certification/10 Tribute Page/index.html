            <p>The Earth is the <strong>third planet from the Sun and the only known planet with life</strong>. It is a unique and dynamic planet that has been evolving for billions of years, sustaining a vast array of life forms and ecosystems. Earth's environment is a complex system that is continuously changing due to natural processes and human activities.</p>
            <p>Earth's atmosphere is composed of roughly 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and small amounts of other gases. The planet's surface is 71% water and 29% land, with the majority of the land located in the Northern Hemisphere. The Earth's magnetic field, which is generated by its iron core, protects the planet from harmful solar winds.</p>
            <p id="list">Here are some interesting and fun facts about Earth:</p>

                <li>The Earth has one moon, which is the fifth largest moon in the solar system.</li>
                <li>Earth's rotation causes the Coriolis effect, which influences the direction of winds and ocean currents.</li>
                <li>The Earth is estimated to be around 4.54 billion years old.</li>
            </ul>

                As <strong>Carl Sagan</strong> famously said, <i>"The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena."</i> This quote reminds us that despite the significant role that Earth plays in our daily lives, it is just one small planet in an incredibly vast universe. It also reminds us of our responsibility to protect and preserve this unique and precious planet for future generations.
